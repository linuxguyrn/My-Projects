# My-Portfolio-Projects
This is some of my work that I am proud enough to show other people. Also contains some beginner projects I thought of out of nowhere.


# Languages
The projects are made in Python, C, Assembly, and others.


# About Me
I am a bit shortsighted and try to make anything I can get my hands on. I mean, I literally sat for an entire day straight just trying to make a shell calculator that calculates the area and perimeter of shapes. And that too between classes! I have 4 Â½ years of experience in coding. And by the way, if you didn't realise by now, I am still under 15 years old!


I also like to play video games, mostly first-person shooters like Valorant, CS 2.0, Overwatch, Splitgate, Apex Legends, etc. I am also a huge fan of anime! I also don't like ads and slow processing, which is why I learned all about computers through learning how to make them, making their OS kernels, and even learning how to make sure that they are of great value by finding out all the ranges and budgets of GPUs and CPUs (this was all done with a little help from websites and a lot of help from Linus Tech Tips!).

I use Linux as my primary Operating System, (Linux Mint Cinnamon to be specific), with my primary browser as Zen, Code Editor as Vim, and I have completely riced out each and every aspect of my system (which you can view in the My_Configs directory).
